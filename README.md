PIPG for Renzedvous and Proximity Operations

We solve a nonconvex rendezvous problem, which is free final time, uses Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics and an impulsive thrust model where the control input is an instantaneous change in velocity. The constraints are maximum speed, maximum control input, and spherical keepout zone. This problem is solved using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) and uses ECOS and PIPG to solve the convex subproblems.
